### Features
- **Components:** The application is structured using React components for better organisation and reusability. 
    Key components include:
  - **PlayerName:** Displays the player's nickname.
  - **Rock, Paper, Scissors:** Icons for player choices.

- **State Management:** The game state is managed using React Hooks (useState).

  - `playerScore` and `computerScore:` Keep track of the scores for both the player and the computer.
  - `playerName:` Stores the player's nickname.
  - `submitted:` Manages the submission status of the player's nickname.
- **Conditionals:** Conditional rendering is used to display different content based on the game state. For instance:
  - The game result is displayed only when the player makes a choice.
  - The PlayerName component is conditionally rendered based on the submission status.
- **Objects and Array Methods:** Arrays and objects are utilised to manage choices and messages in the game.
  - The `choices` array stores the possible game choices.
  - The `messages` object holds win, lose, and draw messages.
- **Multiclass Design:** The application follows a clean and modular design with separate classes for styling and layout.
